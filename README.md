# MyReads Project
It's a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

To install and run:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

# App Functionality
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

 * Currently Reading
 * Want to Read
 * Read
 *

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book.

The search page has a text input to find books.
When you navigate back to the main page from the search page, you should instantly see all of the selections you made on the search page in your library.
